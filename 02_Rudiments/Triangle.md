# Triangle Microlab

## Introduction

This microlab is designed to help you practice solving simple problems in Java. For this microlab you will write several versions of the same program, applying a different set of restrictions each time. The program you write must print out the following figure (Referred to as `The Figure` in each level):

```
*****
****
***
**
*
```

## Level 1:

Write a program that prints The Figure.

## Level 2:

Write a program that prints the figure using only the single-character arguments `*` and `\n` as arguments to `System.out.print()` (You may not use `System.out.println()` and you may not concatenate strings.)

## Level 3:

Write a program that prints the figure using `System.out.print("*");` and `System.out.print("\n");` once each in its source code. No other printing statements of any kind may be used.

## Level 4:

Write a program that prints the figure using `System.out.print("*");` and `System.out.print("\n");` once each in its source code. No other printing statements of any kind may be used and you may not use any `for` loops.

## Level 5: 

Write a program that prints the figure using `System.out.print("*");` and `System.out.print("\n");` once each in its source code. No other printing statements of any kind may be used and you may not use any loops.

## Level 6 (Expert challenge):

Write a program that prints the figure using `System.out.print("*");` and `System.out.print("\n");` once each in its source code. No other printing statements of any kind may be used and you may not use any loops or recursion.

## Level 7 (Just plain crazy):

Write a program that prints the figure using `System.out.print("*");` and `System.out.print("\n");` once each in its source code. No other printing statements of any kind may be used and you may not use any loops. Every line of your program must start with `//`
