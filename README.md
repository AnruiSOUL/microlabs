# Java Microlabs

This project contains tiny labs meant to provide practice with java syntax and constructs.
These labs are not meant to resemble fully mature real-world applications, but instead are
built as minimum-effort examples of each concept. Currently no testing is provided, though
sample solutions may be available for some problems.
